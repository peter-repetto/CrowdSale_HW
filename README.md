# CrowdSale_HW
### For this homework assignment we had to create a crowdsale.  While you can find the sol files in this repo, there were more steps that had to be taken in order to add the coins to MyCrypto wallet. These steps included: 
### 1. Deploy the PupperCoinCrowdSale Doc
### 2. Then you deploy PupperCoin
### 3. Send PCoins to the Wallet
### 4. You will then get a message from Metamask, in order to confirm the transaction. 
### 5. In order to make sure the PCoin made its way into the MyCyrpto wallet.  You will have to copy the address and enter it into the view address tab of MyCyrpto.  You will then see any of the PCoins that you have created.
